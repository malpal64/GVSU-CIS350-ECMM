# Introduction

"Shop 'n Dash" is a delightful and whimsical roguelike game that transforms the ordinary act of grocery shopping into an exhilarating and humorous escapade. Players dive into a procedurally generated grocery store filled with quirky characters, unexpected challenges, and hilarious obstacles. Each playthrough offers a fresh experience as the store layout, item placements, and the cast of comical characters change, ensuring that no two shopping trips are alike.

Players select their shopper avatar, each with a unique set of skills and a dash of personality. From the lightning-fast sprinter to the coupon-clipping expert, shoppers come in various flavors, adding to the game's replayability. As shoppers dash through crowded aisles, they must dodge shopping carts, navigate spilled items, and engage in amusing encounters with fellow shoppers.

To add a layer of strategy and excitement, players are given shopping lists with specific items to collect within a time limit with each level getting progressively more challenging. Completing these quests rewards players with coins that can be spent on unlocking new shoppers, acquiring power-ups, and upgrading the grocery store itself. Power-ups like turbo shopping carts, jetpacks, and shopping cart shields add a dose of mayhem and amusement to the shopping spree, while coupons, discounts, and loyalty cards provide unique advantages.

# Anticipated Technologies

We plan on using Pycharm to code in pygame and pygame-gui, Youtube and the internet for tutorials/references, and github to manage our project documents.

# Method/Approach

We plan on using this [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) and using each part as a guide for what we should be doing each week and what to work on next.
